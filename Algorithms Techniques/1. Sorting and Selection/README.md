# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple, slow sorting algorithm repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple, slow sorting algorithm that insert current value to the front like poker sorting in-place.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort sorts repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides an array into two halves, recurses on both the left and right subarrays, and merges the two sorted halves by comparing which one is larger or smaller.
* Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

## Quick Sort

* Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

## Randomized Selection

Randomized Selection algorithm finds the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
* Time Complexity: O(n)
