# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple, slow sorting algorithm repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple, slow sorting algorithm that insert current value to the front like poker sorting in-place.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort sorts repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)
