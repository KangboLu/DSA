# Tree Algorithms

## 1. Tree Traversal

*1. Preorder:* root, left, right

*Algorithm:*
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree: preorder(leftTree)
3. Traverse the right substree: preorder(rightTree)

*2. Inorder:* left, root, right

*Algorithm:*
1. Traverse the left subtree: inorder(leftTree)
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree: inorder(rightTree)

*3. Postorder:* left, right, root

*Algorithm:*
1. Traverse the left subtree: postorder(leftTree)
2. Traverse the right subtree: postorder(rightTree)
3. Visit the root

*4. Breadth First:* scan left to right, level by level

## 2. Diamter

The diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a path between two nodes.
There may be several maximum-length paths

## 3. All Longest Paths

# Spanning Trees

## 1. Kruskal's Algorithm

## 2. Union-find Structure

## 3. Prim's Algorithm
