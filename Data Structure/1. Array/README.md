# Array
* An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of same type together.
* Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
* Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.

# Static Array
* A static array is a random-access data structure with a fixed size.
* You have to declare its size when you first initialize it.
* To add or remove elements from a static array, you have to create a new appropriately-sized contiguous chunk of memory.

# Dynamic Array
* A dynamic array is random-access, variable-sized list data structure.
* The size of dynamic array will change according to the remove or add operation.
* Logical size: the number of elements being used by the arrayâ€™s contents.
* Physical size: the size of the underlying array.
