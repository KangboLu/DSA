# Tree

A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically. 
With the exception of the top element, each element in a tree has a parent 
element and zero or more children elements. 

A tree is usually visualized by placing elements inside
ovals or rectangles, and by drawing the connections between parents and children
with straight lines. 

We typically call the top element the root of the tree, but it is drawn as the highest element, 
with the other elements being connected below.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is an ordered tree with the following properties:
1. Every node has at most two children.
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child.
3. A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node.
The subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal nodev is called aleft subtree
or right subtree, respectively, of v. 
A binary tree is proper if each node has either zero or two children. 
Some people also refer to such trees as being full binary
trees. Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children.
